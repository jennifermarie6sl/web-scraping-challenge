# web-scraping-challenge

In this project a web application is built that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. 

## Step One
Create code using tools such as Splinter and BeautifulSoup to scrape four sites for various data points. 

## Step Two
Once the data is being scraped accurately insert the data into MongoDB using a Flask App.

## Step Three
Create an HTML file that utilizes the Flask App created above. Include a button to scrape fresh data.  The site should be formatted with Bootstrap CSS styling.

### Installing
In the terminal, run the FlaskApp file.  Navigate to the site and press the button to scrape fresh data.  

Doing this should display a web page that looks something like this:
